### Gene Assembing Program for NGS
#Overview


This is a program which can assembing gene fragments from Next Generation Sequencing(NGS) *de novo*.
It implements two functions:
-Assembling gene contigs from gene fragments in .fasta file from NGS *de novo* using *De Bruijn Algorithms*.
-Provide a user optional function mapping contigs to reference sequence using heuristic algorithms like BLAST.
The k-mer data is stored in a self-defined hash table to optimize storage space and reduce computional complexity.


The GUI of this program is in Chinese, and a specification of the program is shown below:
